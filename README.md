## Introduction

This project is designed to interact with a University API to retrieve student data from a API in a JSON format from which we calculate credit hours, GPAs, and perform automated actions such as dropping courses based on specific criteria.

## Features

- Fetch student details from the University API
- Calculate total credit hours and GPA for each student
- Automatically drop courses for full-time students with grades below 40
- Reset the test database to clear application state
